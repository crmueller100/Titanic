# Titanic
This is my attempt of Kaggle's Titanic Machine Learning Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). The motivation behind doing this project is my desire to increase my data science skills. I have a familiarity with some machine learning concepts, but doing an actual competition is the best way to learn data science skills including algorithms and programming. It is also an exercise to help me learn to use with my github account. 

My first attempt utilized the Logistic Regression linear model from the sklearn class.
